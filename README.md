# Robotics_NavStrategies
This project is part of the Robotics course from Instituto Superior Técnico and the main goal of this project is to implement a navigation strategy so that the Pioneer-3DX robot is able to follow a reference trajectory, evaluating if there is any opened or semi-opened door.

In order to control the robot we will be using the Laser Range Finder (LRF) to evaluate the distance between the robot and the wall. The LRF will also be used to evaluate the depth between the wall and the door in order to evaluate whether the door is opened, semi-opened or closed.
